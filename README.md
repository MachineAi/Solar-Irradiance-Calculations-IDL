# Solar-Irradiance-Calculations

## Programs to handle solar geometry

Description: A set of programs to calculate extraterrestrial solar irradiance, sun paths, direct and diffuse radiation for a given location. Developped for teaching solar geometry.

## rad_solar_constant.pro

Calculates the current solar irradiance at top of the atmosphere perpendicular to sun rays in W / m2 using the solar constant and correcting for the changing distance Earth-Sun.

## Programs to handle date and time conversions

### dat_dat2doy.pro

Calculates for a given day, month, and year the day of the year (doy).

### dat_months.pro

Returns the first day of year (doy) for all twelve months. 

### dat_leapyear.pro

Checks if a year is a leap-year.
