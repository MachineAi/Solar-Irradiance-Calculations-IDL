# Solar-Irradiance-Calculations

## Programs to handle solar geometry

Description: A set of programs to calculate extraterrestrial solar irradiance, sun paths, direct and diffuse radiation for a given location. Useful for teaching solar geometry.

## ubc_rad_solar_constant.pro

Calculates the current solar irradiance at top of the atmosphere perpendicular to sun rays in W / m2 using the solar constant and correcting for the changing distance Earth-Sun.

## Programs to handle date and time conversions

### dat_months.pro

Returns an array with every first day of year (doy) for all 12 months.

### dat_leapyear.pro

Checks if a year is a leap-year.
